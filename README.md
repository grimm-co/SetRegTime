This repository is a rewrite of [jschicht's SetRegTime](https://github.com/jschicht/SetRegTime)
utility. The previous version was written in AutoIt, which made it a pain to
modify. Additionally, the previous version did not always exit with the correct
exit code, which made its use in automated scripts troublesome.

This version has been tested and is known to work on Windows 10.
